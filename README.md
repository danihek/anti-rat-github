# Anti rat punsher

## Why?
- because recently I've seen a lot of sus github accounts with these kind of **tricks** to say at least.

## What does script do?
If you provide domain it will send to ***them*** random crap, generated by python scripts. I don't know if it works but it should be safe because script uses new tor connection every cycle in loop.

I found that these 'rats' I don't know how to call them are very simmilar, so if you wanna expose someone just decrypt it using fernet and base64.
