# Anti rat punisher

## Why?
- because recently I've seen a lot of sus github accounts with these kind of **tricks** in repos to say at least.
- If you are interested I talked about it here: [youtube](https://youtu.be/X1YiQpikL9Q?si=63PMrosf14T2nNwg)

## What does script do?
If you provide domain it will send to ***them*** random crap, generated by python scripts. I don't know if it works but it should be safe because script uses new tor connection every cycle in loop.

I found that these 'rats' I don't know how to call them are very simmilar, so if you wanna expose someone just decrypt it using fernet and base64.

## How to run
Download repo and python requirements.
Tor is optional but recommended.

```
git clone https://github.com/danihek/anti-rat-github
cd anti-rat-github
```

Run
``./unrat.sh -d https://example.donotexist``
